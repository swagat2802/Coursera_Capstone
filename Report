Capstone Project – The Battle of Neighbourhoods

Project Title: Helping Customers with their first home

Introduction/Business Problem:
When buying a new house, most people are concerned about the locality, facilities and restaurants available nearby. The problem in most cities is that people are not able to find the best location to buy a new house.
My idea is to use the Foursquare location data to find areas with ample facilities nearby and provide this information to people that can help them to buy a new house.
I am working with a leading bank in Ireland. So my plan is to provide this data science drive insights to our customers to buy a new house in Dublin and surrounding areas, and with that provide our mortgage (home loan) product.
Here, my target audience is both Stakeholders and Customers.
•	For Customers – This project can help to provide insights to customers that can help them to buy their house, and also provide them Mortgage from our bank.

•	For Stakeholders – This project can help the stakeholder audience to increase the Mortgage sales, and thereby generate more revenue. 


Here, I am able to hit both the targets – Serve Customers Brilliantly and Grow Sustainable Profits by selling Mortgage products.


Data Requirements:
For implementing this project, I will be using the Foursquare location data. I will use this data, to find best possible location to buy a new house.







Results section where you discuss the results:
Based on above output values between Dublin 2 and Dublin 4 can help the customers to pick the best location to buy their new home.
